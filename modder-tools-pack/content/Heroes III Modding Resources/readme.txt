Thank you for checking this resource repository out!

Please use these icons for your mods henceforth so people (me) don't have to go back retroactively fixing graphical issues or low quality graphics <3

All non-Complete and non-HOTA creature specialties will be tagged with their appropriate mod, e.g. (ToW) or (WoG).

Anything that HOTA changed that differs from Complete will also be tagged with (HotA)

Please let me know if you'd like me to create/upload more icons from other mods or sources.

=== NOTES ===
- All non-Complete or non-HOTA specialties were created by me in the same style as the originals, ensuring high quality and low file sizes.
- For secondary skill specialists, use the Basic/Expert form of that skill as specialty icons as needed if there is no specialty image for that skill.
	- Typically, the Basic icon is used.
	- In cases such as Adrienne (starts with Expert Fire Magic) then the Expert icon is used.
	- In my New Old Heroes mod, for Gwenneth (Scholar specialist, +1 level of spells taught/learned per level of Scholar) I elected to use the
	  Expert icon due to how her specialty capitalises on the Expert level of Scholar now teaching level 5 spells, so it depends on how you use
	  the specialty! I'd say that if it works differently to a standard secondary skill specialty, use the Expert icon to emphasise that!
- Ancient Behemoths are the icon for the Behemoth specialty by default; I've included the standard Behemoth icon for the sake of it, especially since
  HOTA changed Magic Elementals -> Psychic Elementals and Cerberi -> Hell Hounds in their images.
- The alternate creature backgrounds are reconstructed using the game's resources directly from where the original backgrounds are found but differ from
  the standard creature background image; for example, neutral1 is an area from a combat background, but if we compare the standard creature background
  image against the combat background, we see that it is slightly different. My neutral1 alternative image is a combination of the original combat
  background and the default creature background, as the mountains and ground are separated by 1px more in the default creature background. My Conflux
  alternate background is taken from the town's in-game appearance, whereas the original features slightly different (perhaps unfinished) scenery.
