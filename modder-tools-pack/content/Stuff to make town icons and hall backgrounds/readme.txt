How to use it:
There are 32bit transparent PNGs that can be used to make town icons (they have border and checks on them). Create 2-layer file, on 1st layer place town icon, on second place one of these files.

Also there is multi-layer template Paint.NET for creating town hall backgrounds.
It already has lot of hall icons variants on diff layers.
