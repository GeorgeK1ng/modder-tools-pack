How to use it:

I’d like to share PDN multi-layer file for Paint.NET 1, that I’m using to easily create puzzles for new factions.
It’s not classic, I tried only to make easy and quick way for puzzles, not bother with H3 puzzle style.

	1. Place picture of correct size (596X546) on “Picture layer”.
	2. make layer 47 visible (other numbered layers must be hidden). “Save as” 8-bit 00.bmp.
	3. Hide 47 layer, make 46 layer visible. repeat this until you have 00-47.bmp on your disk.
	4. JSON puzzle file for them also in archive.
	5. Just rename “mytown” by your town identifier.
